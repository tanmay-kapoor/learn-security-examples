# Privilege Escalation

The example demonstrates a privilege escalation vulnerability and how to exploit it.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Install all dependencies

   `$ npm install`

2. Start the **insecure.ts** server

   `$ npx ts-node insecure.ts`

3. In the browser, send a GET request

    ```
        http://localhost:3000/send-form
    ```

4. Try different UserIds and see which one gives you authorized access to change the role of that user.

## For you to do

Answer the following:

1. Briefly explain the potential vulnerabilities in **insecure.ts**

- Insecure Authentication: The app only simulates authentication; it just looks for a user in the users array by the
  provided userId, which makes it very easy to spoof any identity.

- Weak Authorization: Authorization check is only done regarding the user's role being 'admin' before updating any role.
  A vulnerability like that could be leveraged by users manipulating the requests to elevate their privileges.

- Insufficient Input Validation: The input newRole isn't validated; this allows an attacker to assign arbitrary roles,
  potentially further compromising the system.

2. Briefly explain how a malicious attacker can exploit them.

- An attacker can guess or provide a valid userId to impersonate another user because of the insecure authentication
  mechanism implemented.
- Privilege Escalation: An attacker holding a valid userId would be able to tamper with the request and update his role
  to have admin privileges or change roles of other users, bypassing proper authorization.
- Without input validation for the newRole, an attacker can assign unauthorized or even malicious roles, which might
  disrupt the system or provide unauthorized access.

3. Briefly explain the defensive techniques used in **secure.ts** to prevent the privilege escalation vulnerability?

- Session-Based Authentication: Logs the user in by creating a session and allows only authorized users to access the
  update-role endpoint, then denies access if unauthorized.
- Validating inputs: The userId and newRole inputs are validated to allow only valid and expected data to be processed,
  which prevents malicious role assignments or unauthorized updates of a user. - Role-Based Authorization: Checking the
  role of the logged-in user against the session data to make sure they have the necessary 'admin' privileges before
  allowing such sensitive actions of updating roles.
